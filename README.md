# CTF365
Practise CTF every day!

## About
We setup this repo for CTF lovers.
As you know that it would not be easy to grant a number of services run properly, please do not try to do damage.
If you find something unexpected, contact us or leave an issue.

We now supply a [platform](http://10.131.1.19/ctfcircle) *in fudan internal network* for you to submit the flag you find. Notice that the invite code is not neccessary when register.

## Useful Tools
Due to the GFW, it could be really slow when downloading some big tools. So I downloaded them and store them on my server. You can find those tools on http://fdureal.nxtinc.cf/public/ . __THIS SITE IS ONLY ACCESSIBLE FROM FUDAN INTERNAL NETWORK__.

If you need some tools however it's outside the wall and you cannot get that, raise an issue.
