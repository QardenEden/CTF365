# CTF365
Practise CTF every day!

## About
We setup this repo for CTF lovers, and especially for the beginners.
As you know, it's not easy to have all of the games running properly at the same time. So if you find anything unexpected, contact us or leave an issue.
Once you break into an environment, please do not try to do any damage. On the other hand, we will spare no effort to keep everything under our control.

We now supply a [platform](http://ctf.fudan.edu.cn/ctfcircle) for you to verify the flag you find. Notice that the invitation code on registration is not neccessary.

We give descriptions and solutions for each game. Feel free to view the solution if you have no idea how to get the flag. We actually suggest the beginners follow the solution to get the flag, but not stare at the screen and do nothing for hours.

## Flag Format
Most flags submitted should be wrapped with `*ctf{}`.
If a flag is not surrounded by curly braces, please wrap it with `*ctf{}` at submission.
If a flag is surrounded by an unusual tag and curly braces, keep it intact.

## Useful Tools
Due to the Chinese GFW, it can be slow to download some tools. So we downloaded them and stored them on our server. You can find these tools on our [platform](http://fdu.6stars.cf/res/). __THIS SITE IS ONLY ACCESSIBLE IN FUDAN INTERNAL NETWORK__.

If you need any tool which is outside the GFW and you cannot get it, leave an issue.
