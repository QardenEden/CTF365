Robots exclusion protocol is used for web site in order to notify web crawlers(like search engines) which sites are not allowed to visit and crawl.

What they do not want us to visit often contains important information. So it's usually useful to open robots.txt.

In this case, you can find a "top secret" in robots.txt. This url is just what we need.
